    <blockquote>
      <p>"Her eyes had called him and his soul had leaped at the call. To live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life!"</p>

      <p>His father told him that story: his father looked at him through a glass: he had a hairy face.</p>
      <p>He was baby tuckoo. The moocow came down the road where Betty Byrne lived: she sold lemon platt.</p>

Grafton Street, along which he walked, prolonged that moment of discouraged poverty. In the roadway at the head of the street a slab was set to the memory of Wolfe Tone and he remembered having been present with his father at its laying. He remembered with bitterness that scene of tawdry tribute. There were four French delegates in a brake and one, a plump smiling young man, held, wedged on a stick, a card on which were printed the words: <em>VIVE L'IRLANDE</em>!</p>

      <p>"Business Process Modeling Language (<strong>BPML</strong>) is an <em>XML</em>-based language for business process modeling.

It is used for developing <em>audio</em> and <em>voice</em> response applications, such as banking systems and automated customer service portals. VoiceXML applications are developed and deployed in a manner analogous to how a web browser interprets and visually renders the Hypertext Markup Language (<strong>HTML</strong>) it receives from a web server."</p>
